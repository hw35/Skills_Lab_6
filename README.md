# Skills_Lab_6

Our program takes in two inputs, a name and age, and tells you your age tow years prior!
To use our program, you first need to download the python notebook and have a software that can run a python notebook. We suggest using JupyterHub!
To contribute to our program, you can edit directly on github by locating the program within the outser shell of the notebook code. Another alternative is to downlaod the program and edit it and submit a new pull request with a new file!
